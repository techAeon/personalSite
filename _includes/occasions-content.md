## Days That Matter

Some dates pull at me more than others. A handful of them change the colour of this site for a few days each year — not as a gimmick, but because the calendar genuinely shapes how I experience the work and the cities I move between.

### National Cherry Blossom Festival {#cherry-blossom}

*Washington DC, late March to mid-April*

I lived near Dupont Circle for three years before Munich, and the blossoms along the Tidal Basin always marked the moment when the year started to feel real. The city fills briefly with people who would ordinarily walk past each other without looking up.

The trees were a diplomatic gift — 3,000 of them, from Tokyo in 1912 — and I think about that sometimes from the IP side: a gift explicitly made without strings attached, before the modern era of cultural heritage protection and geographical indications. You could not quite do it the same way today, legally or politically.

The festival runs for several weeks and the peak bloom window is maybe five days if you are lucky. It rewards patience and punishes planning.

### Oktoberfest {#oktoberfest}

*Munich, mid-September to early October*

I moved to Munich partly because the European Patent Office is here, and partly because I had been told the quality of life was extraordinary. Both turned out to be true. Oktoberfest is the most visible expression of a Bavarian identity that is quite distinct from German identity in ways that take years to appreciate.

Yes, I own lederhosen. They were a gift from colleagues at my first Munich firm and are worn with genuine affection rather than irony. The festival itself is remarkable because it is simultaneously a deeply local tradition — held on the same grounds since 1810, when it celebrated Crown Prince Ludwig's wedding — and one of the most internationally attended events on earth. The Bierzelt crowd on a Tuesday afternoon is a particular sociological phenomenon.

The blue accent comes from the Bavarian flag: white and light blue lozenges, a pattern that has appeared on Bavarian heraldry since the thirteenth century.

### World IP Day {#world-ip-day}

*April 26th*

April 26th is the date the WIPO Convention entered into force in 1970, and WIPO has observed it as World IP Day since 2001. I do not always agree with WIPO on policy — the balance between protection and access is genuinely contested, and reasonable people land in different places.

But I appreciate having a date on the calendar that invites people to think seriously about why intellectual property law exists, who it serves, and whether it is serving them well. It is a corrective to the caricature of patent work as purely transactional, and a useful occasion to explain what I actually do to people who assume it involves either corporate villainy or incomprehensible technicality.

It is also the one day of the year when my parents reliably ask me how work is going.

### Constitution Day {#us-constitution-day}

*September 17th*

The Constitution was signed on September 17th, 1787. Article I, Section 8 included the intellectual property clause — Congress shall have power to promote the progress of science and useful arts — which means that IP is one of the few areas of law explicitly contemplated by the founders. As a US practitioner based abroad, I find that clause worth remembering annually.

It also means that American IP law carries a teleological purpose baked into its constitutional foundation: the goal is progress, and protection is the mechanism, not the end. That framing matters for how you argue cases and counsel clients.

### German Unity Day {#german-unity}

*October 3rd*

October 3rd has a particular resonance in Munich, where reunification is commemorated with a mixture of pride and the specific Bavarian ambivalence about Berlin that you only understand after living here for a while.

I arrived well after 1990, but I have spent enough time in the old East and West to understand something of what the day means to people who lived through the division. The combined patent portfolio of East German state enterprises after reunification was one of the largest IP integration challenges in European history — an enormous body of innovation that had developed in a completely different legal environment and had to be harmonised almost overnight.

It is a reminder that IP systems are not neutral infrastructure. They reflect the political economies that built them.
