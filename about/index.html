        <h1>About Me</h1>
      </header>

      <p>If you made it here, you probably found me through the patent world — but there's more to the story than prosecution deadlines and claim drafts. I'm Kieran, a US patent attorney and IP strategist currently based in Munich, with one foot perpetually in Pittsburgh. I moved to Bavaria for a role at 2SPL Patentanwälte and somehow never left, which might have something to do with the Biergärten.</p>

      <p>I've spent the last decade or so helping companies — from scrappy startups to major international corporations — figure out what's worth protecting, how to protect it, and what to do when someone else comes too close. My technical background spans machine learning, medical imaging, semiconductors, and telecommunications, which means I get to spend my days translating complex innovations into documents that actually hold up in the real world.</p>

      <p>Day to day, I lead the US practice group at 2SPL, coordinating with attorneys and agents across the USPTO, EPO, JPO, and CNIPA. That means cross-cultural communication, tight deadlines, and the occasional late-night message when Munich and Pittsburgh time zones refuse to cooperate. It also means I genuinely love what I do — IP law is endlessly interesting when you're working at the intersection of technology, strategy, and human ingenuity.</p>

      <p>Outside the office, you'll find me on the rugby pitch playing second row, in the kitchen working through a new recipe, or somewhere in the middle of a German lesson. My rescue Galgo — a retired racer from Spain — is my perpetual companion and a daily reminder that good outcomes require patience and consistency, whether you're writing a patent claim or teaching a dog to sit.</p>

      <p>I'm also a builder of sorts. My current side project, <a href="/personalSite/projects">Pulverhorn</a>, is a preissuance submission service for anonymous USPTO filings — built for inventors who have something worth saying but good reasons for saying it quietly. There's always something on the workbench.</p>
